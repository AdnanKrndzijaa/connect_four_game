# Connect Four (Rust)

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game in which the players take turns dropping their elements into a grid. 
The game board consists of a grid with at least seven columns and six rows. 
The objective of the game is to be the first player to get four of your elements in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The players can choose to play with x or o elements, and the players take turns dropping their elements into the grid from the top. 
The element falls to the lowest available space in the column. 
The player who succeeds in placing four of their elements in a row first is the winner. 
If the grid is completely filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

The project was done as part of the **IT 305 Programming Languages** course at International Burch University, and implemented in the **Rust** programming language.
